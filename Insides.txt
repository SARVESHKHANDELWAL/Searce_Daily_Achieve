Document AI

1.Manage the entire unstructured document lifecycle in one unified solution
2.Reduce the manual document processing -> minimise the time and setup cost and accelerate the process and deployment.
3.Using google API’s we can achieve the high level accuracy.
4.We can use the document data to gain more insights about the customers product.


Automate the document processing workflows 

-> Takes unstructured data from documents.

Uses
- [ ] Pre process the document with image quality detection. 
- [ ] Extract text and layout info from document files.
- [ ] We can get key value pair in structured forms.
- [ ] Document Classification 
- [ ] Store, Search, Organise , Govern and Analyse. (Document AI workspace) 


Types of processor 
1. Document OCR 
2. Form Parser
3. Specialised  Classifier 

Using Document AI processors 

Step 1 : Choose the processor. (Acc to use case)
Step 2: Create the processor (Document AI API) 
Step 3: Send the document (For processing)


# HITL - Human In the loop -> Human verification and corrections to ensure the accuracy of data extracted by Document AI processors for use in many critical business ideas.


How ocr is different from form parser in python? 

1. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is the process of detecting and extracting text in images through Computer Vision.
2. Document Parsing involves examining the data in a document and extracting useful information.
